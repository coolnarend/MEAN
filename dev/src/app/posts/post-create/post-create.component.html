  <h3>Two way data binding</h3>
  <!-- ngModel is an angular feature,it's a so-called directive. A directive is basically an instruction you place on an html element
  and angular or you can also create your own one so that the relative knows what to do on that element then. ngModel is a directive
  that actually will listen to user input and emit that data to us and also store new data in that text area or output it there.
  Now important, ngModel by default won't work, it's a feature which is not included in the core angular package here, it's not included in the browser
  module which we already added, it's included in a different module which we need to add, it's included in the so-called forms module because it's related to forms inputs and this is part
  of @angular/forms, so that's still part of the core framework but of a different part of the framework.

  <!-- Template driven form -->
